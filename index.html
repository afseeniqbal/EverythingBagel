   <p class= "didYouKnowInfo"><strong> In the United States, 40% of all food is wasted. We use 25% of the freshwater we use to grow food that we never eat. We use 4% of the oil we use to make food that we never eat. We spend $166 billion (retail value of avoidable waste) on food that we never eat. The climate change dilemma is made worse by food loss and waste because of the large greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions it produces. Food-related activities including production, handling, and transportation emit a lot of carbon dioxide (CO2), and when it ends up in landfills, it releases methane, an even more potent greenhouse gas. </strong></p>

  <p class="HWWTHInfo"> Our problem is with how much food is wasted in the US and how people generally eat unhealthily, because it raises moral and medical issues. We want to take this chance to provide two solutions so that we can help change this nightmare one person at a time. We have resources for where you can donate your leftover food or even brand new food, and we have compiled unique recipes from three distinct cuisines that are low-waste, high-reward, and most importantly, delicious!  Enjoy!
